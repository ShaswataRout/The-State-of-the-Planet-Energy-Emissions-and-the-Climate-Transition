# The State of the Planet: Energy, Emissions & the Climate Transition
A comprehensive analysis of global energy consumption, emissions, sector-wise climate impact and the road to net zero.


## 📌 Project Overview

A climate dashboard built to answer “Are we changing fast enough?” rather than “What happened last year?”:

  - Where do emissions come from?

  - How is the energy system evolving?

  - Are clean alternatives scaling fast enough?

  - Are we on track for future climate targets?

Instead of building isolated charts, this project follows a structured analytical framework to tell a coherent climate story.

Using global energy and CO₂ data, the project focuses on three core ideas:

  1. Reality – Where emissions and energy use stand today

  2. Drivers – Which fuels, sectors, and regions are responsible

  3. Direction – Whether current trends align with climate targets

Every dashboard, KPI, and chart exists to support one of these ideas.

## 🧠 The questions driving the analysis

Every dashboard in this project exists to answer one (or more) of these questions:

  - Are global emissions still rising, or finally slowing?

  - Where is our energy really coming from?

  - Are renewables replacing fossil fuels or just adding extra capacity?

  - Which sectors are the hardest to decarbonize?

  - Who emits the most, and who bears the burden?

  - Are current trends aligned with climate targets?



## Energy composition in transition: Fossil fuels vs renewables

Despite rapid growth in renewable energy consumption, global energy demand has increased at a pace that continues to sustain fossil fuel dominance.
